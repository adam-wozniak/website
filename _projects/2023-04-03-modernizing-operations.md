In 2022, upon being promoted to Senior Director, Operations of a 130 person tech consulting company, I launched into executing my vision of modernizing our operations tech stack.

Specifically, my goal was to replace the existing error-prone, cumbersome, and time-consuming manual processes (primarily consisting of lots of spreadsheets and disjointed systems) that linked our sales pipeline, revenue forecasts, resourcing, project/account financials, and invoicing journey. The existing jumble of spreadsheets and disjointed tools was inherited from past years, and previous operations teams and leaders had not been successful in replacing it with a solution that would be more automated, scalable, and real-time. After all, in a fast-moving organization like this one, this would be the equivalent of trying to lay tracks ahead of a moving train.

But I always like a good challenge, especially when it involves bringing much-needed change to the heart of a company. Having done something similar at a much smaller company years before http://www.adamwozniak.com/work/business-operations, this time was going to involve much higher stakes. But the overall goal was going to be the same â€“ replace the existing jumble with a proper Professional Services Automation (PSA) solution, without causing any disruption to business as usual.

I am happy to say that I successfully accomplished my vision, retiring all the old spreadsheets and disjointed tools, and rolling out the PSA solution first to our account teams (to quickly enable mission-critical project financials, invoicing, and revenue forecasting), then subsequently onboarding our finance team, craft leads, and leadership. I designed the roll out to address highest business value work first as I progressed through the different teams.
