In 2018, I worked for an insurtech professional services company. Due to corporate restructuring, there was a need to find as many operational efficiencies as quickly as possible, before a fast-approaching cut-off for the old systems.

After thorough analysis of the options on the market, I single-handedly implemented a new Professional Services Automation (PSA) system company-wide, removing reliance on manual spreadsheets (eg. resource management, project status reports, financial and utilization forecasting spreadsheets), as well as enabling new capabilities in the areas of project management, finance, timesheet management, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM). I implemented the system in several phases, focusing on highest business impact first.

The implementation went off without any major issues and without any downtime during transition. In addition to gaining new operational efficiencies with the new system, I also reduced operational costs by 70% (which didnâ€™t include the additional, substantial cost savings of no longer having to do most of the work manually in spreadsheets).
