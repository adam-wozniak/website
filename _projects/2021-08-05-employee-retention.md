In 2018, upon being promoted to a Director role, I immediately implemented a gamified employee peer-to-peer recognition and rewards program to boost engagement and retention, while surfacing valuable contributions, highlighting team dynamics, and providing a framework for engagement experiments to reward teamwork and personal initiative.

The program:

- improved company culture
- resulted in 100% user adoption
- changed user behaviour (eg. Friday timesheet submission compliance was close to 0% weekly; after implementing the program, it rose to 94%-100% and was never a problem again, which had important cash flow implications for the business)
- contributed to high employee retention (over 90%)

All the above was achieved with very low financial investment.
