From 2003-2006, I was heavily involved in Australia’s (then) number 1 community radio station. Starting as a broadcaster of a late-night comedy radio show, I eventually landed a guest hosting stint on the station’s flagship breakfast show, while also running the university student radio department (for which I won an award).

During my time there, I personally wrote, produced, and presented 100+ hours of on-air content, while also training and developing broadcasters who have since moved successfully into the commercial radio, TV, and film industries around the world.
