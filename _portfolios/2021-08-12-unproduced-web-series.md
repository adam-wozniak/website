From 2010-2013, I developed two (unproduced) comedy web series, as well as teaming up with a credited executive producer to co-write a third comedy web series, which we ended up pitching, unsuccessfully, to a government film funding body in 2011.

As part of the pitch materials, we also pitched a companion mobile game that we intended to develop, since we saw big opportunities in the mobile space that hadnâ€™t been capitalized on yet.
