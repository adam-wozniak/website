From 2009-2011, I was really into self-development, personal improvement, and minimalism. Inspired by the likes of Leo Babauta ([Zen Habits](https://zenhabits.net/)) and [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/), I ended up launching my own self-development blog.

After writing a book’s worth of articles, including some that ranked highly on Google, averaging over 10,000 page views per month from over 168 countries, and even having the [founder of Stack Overflow](https://blog.codinghorror.com/todont/) reference one of my articles, I sold the blog.
