Produced in 2005, Wozniak Live was a pilot for a late-night comedy TV series. While the pilot was rejected by every major TV network in Australia, it eventually made its way to community and cable television networks across Australia and New Zealand in 2011 and 2012. 

The TV pilot was a life-changing experience. Not only did I recruit and lead 30 volunteers, as well as providing a compelling vision for what we could build together, but I persisted with the project even after it died 3 times. It took considerable effort over 18 months, often working daily and on weekends while studying and working multiple part-time jobs. All the work producing, directing, writing, hosting, and shooting in indoor and outdoor locations, culminated in a live show filmed in front of a studio audience (a day after being diagnosed with laryngitis...).  

This experience taught me the importance of relentlessly pursuing a dream, and realizing that big things can be accomplished from literally nothing but an idea in your head. While we often canâ€™t control the outcome, what we can do is show up and do the work.
